## Hi, my name is Aur√©lien St√©b√© and <br/> I am a recovering Enterprise Java developer.

<br/>

My career started at the back of the back-end of Web development with SQL and Unix.\
I slowly made my way to the front, building websites using Groovy, Python, Wordpress,\
... all the while secretly thinking to myself: "Jim ! There's gotta be a _better_ way !"

I arrived late to the NodeJS party, but just in time for the Jamstack (coding like in\
the 90s, yes please!). The gradual componentization of the UI had started (great,\
loved legos as a kid) and the age of the SSR/SSG JS frameworks had dawned ...

React already had its own (NextJS, Gatsby), VueJS ditto (NuxtJS, Gridsome), Svelte had\
Sapper, even Angular was working on Scully. All very worthy choices, but then I noticed\
Marko and its corresponding ... nothing ?!? Well, I _was_ looking for a project to build.

<br/>

This is the origin story of the [**GladeJS**](https://github.com/gladejs/gladejs) : Rollup, Marko and Eleventy sitting in a tree ...

<br/>

[Marko](https://markojs.com) is the eBay front-end UI library that nobody knows about, probably because there\
is no framework supporting it, probably because nobody knows about it, probably beca...\
[Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev), I heard about a few months into my prototype: all of the features I needed and\
none of those I had already implemented (and none of the calories). Thanks a lot, Zach ! üëç

Wanna have a chat ? Lately, you may find me around [Discord](https://discord.com) on the following servers :

- [Marko](https://discord.gg/RFGxYGs), discussing the future Marko v6.0 syntax with the maintainers
- [Eleventy](https://discord.gg/GBkBy9u), furiously taking notes on the recurring questions & issues
- [Party-Corgi](https://www.partycorgi.com), sampling the ambiance and getting ready to participate

Finally, I _am_ currently looking for remote employment, so please consult my [**resume**](./RESUME.md).
